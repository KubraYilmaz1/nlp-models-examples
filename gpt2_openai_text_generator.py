# "I have two dogs and one is a pit bull. I don't want to be around them." The dog owner, who did not wish to give
# his name for fear of reprisals from the animal rights group that has been campaigning against him since he adopted
# it in 2010, said: "It's very upsetting because they are my family members but we can never go back there now. We
# will always live with this guilt over what happened here."

# A new study by researchers at Harvard University suggests that people may actually prefer their own gender when
# making decisions about romantic partners â€” even if those choices aren't based on biological sex or sexual
# orientation. The findings suggest that our preferences might change as society becomes more accepting of same-sex
# relationships.
